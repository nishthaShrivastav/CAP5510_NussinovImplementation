RNA plays an important role in many biological processes such as catalysis and protein synthesis. RNA structure is hierarchical but the secondary structure is formed separately and predicting this structure is independent of the primary and tertiary structures. In this paper study the types of algorithms used for RNA structure prediction and we present a comparison of two  such algorithms- Nussinov’s dynamic programming and Sfold algorithm. We compare the results in terms of accuracy by using known structures as reference. We also compare the algorithms’ computation times. The dataset of primary and secondary structure of the RNA was obtained from the http://www.rnasoft.ca/strand/

# Sample input :
filename.txt - Name of the file with rna primary structure in FASTA format

# Sample output: 
Number of paired bases found 30
Secondary Structure after folding: ((()))()()(((((()()()((((((()()()()(((((()())))))))))))))))).
Computation time: 3 ms
